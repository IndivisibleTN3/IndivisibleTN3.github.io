#### Indivisible - Oak Ridge ####

Indivisible is a grassroots movement that relies on protest techniques and tactics born out of the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War struggles and most recently practiced effectively by the Tea Party.  We have oriented our communications towards our Members of Congress in order to demonstrate opposition to the unjust, illogical, and often unconstitutional Trump Agenda.  By continuing vocal opposition to this administration’s policy preferences we hope to persuade our legislators to reject this president and his goals and provide material to the media demonstrating active resistance.
